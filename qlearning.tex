\section{Agent: Temporal Difference Learning with Q-Learning}
\label{sec:qlearning}
I tried two approaches for training an agent with temporal difference learning.
First, I simply tried training the agent by letting it play Ms. Pac-Man,
adjusting expectations according to actual game scores. Then I tried training it
by giving it a high reward for actions that the GA agent would have picked in the
same state, and low rewards for different actions. Neither of these approaches
where particularly successful.

The score earned by this agent usually lies around 2000 points.
Interestingly, weather I train the agent on half a million game-runs or 3
million game runs made little to no difference.
