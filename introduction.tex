\section{Introduction}
This report describes the implementation of three Ms. Pac-Man controllers (agents):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A finite state automata whose transitions are determined by a genetic
		algorithm (section \ref{sec:GA}).
	\item An agent trained with temporal difference learning (section
		\ref{sec:qlearning}).
	\item An agent controlled by monte carlo tree search (section \ref{sec:mcts})
\end{enumerate}
