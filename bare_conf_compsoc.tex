\section{Implementations}
The implementations are handed in as three different source directories, one for
each agent. This is not particularly clean, as share some code (e.g. the pacman
source code), but it was the easiest, as they share code with modifications.

Each directory contains a \texttt{src} folder, which in turn contains one or
more folders with the prefix "sidi". These package contain the agents.

The agent implementations are all based on the source code provided to us for
the weekly labs, I did not write any of it from scratch, but they contain
extensive modifications.
