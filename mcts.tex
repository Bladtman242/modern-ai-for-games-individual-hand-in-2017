\section{Then, for each of the 3 approaches:}
\label{sec:mcts}

\subsection{Description of Approach (e.g. input, output, action, state space,
representation)}

\subsection{Algorithm Parameters:}

\subsection{Which parameters needed to be adjusted (e.g. ANN learning rate),
which were picked by default (e.g. connection weight interval) and why?}

\subsection{What was the experiment followed to adjust those parameters of the
algorithm.}

\subsection{Performance measure of the algorithm}

\subsection{Experiments (My player against the provided Ô¨Åxed-players)}
Conclusions (Why did it work? Why it didn't work? If it didn't work as expected what could you suggest that it has to be changed for the algorithm to work and why didn't you try it?)
